# Conway Classics

With help from various videos on YouTube for the rules, over the past 4 years, I've implemented two famous algorithms of the mathematician Mr Conway.

I may add stuff soon, but I am still learning GitHub. 
I would like anyone to request any change in the file, but I don't want anyone to add any new files.
I don't know how it can be implemented; all I know is that I want to push the code for now.

Anyway, you'll get two files:
  1) Calendar, Day Finder, Day Quizzer (Doomsday Algorithm)
  2) Game of Life (made this on a night of Jan or Feb 2024)

Special features:
  1) In **Doomsday Alg**, you may enter any year you wish. You will get your Gregorian calendar for that year.
  2) In the **Game of Life**, delays and '\f' have been used. Again, I want to state: that you can update the code.

Both of these have been implemented for BlueJ, so you may request to change the code for seamless execution universally.

## What you need to change

Try to make it CLI-suited. For example, as I was saying, '\f' should be replaced with '\b' or something else, which is suitable for CLI universally. The reason I'm not doing this is that it will make the program very less efficient.
