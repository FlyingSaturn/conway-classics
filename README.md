With help from various videos on YouTube for the rules, along the course of the past 4 years, I've implemented two famous algorithms of the mathematician Mr. Conway.

I may add stuff soon, but I am still learning GitHub. 
I would like anyone to request any change in the file, but I don't want anyone to add any new files.
I don't know how it can be implemented; all I know is that I want to push code for now.

Anyway, you'll get two files:
  1) Calendar (Doomsday Algorithm)
  2) Game of Life

Both of these have been implemented for BlueJ, so you may request to change the code for seamless execution universally.
