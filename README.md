With help from various videos on YouTube for the rules, along the course of the past 4 years, I've implemented two famous algorithms of the mathematician Mr. Conway.

I may add stuff soon, but I am still learning GitHub. 
I would like anyone to request any change in the file, but I don't want anyone to add any new files.
I don't know how it can be implemented; all I know is that I want to push code for now.

Anyway, you'll get two files:
  1) Calendar, Day Finder, Day Quizzer (Doomsday Algorithm)
  2) Game of Life

Special features:
  1) In the Doomsday Alg, you may enter any year you wish. You will get your Gregorian calendar for that year.
  2) In the Game of Life, delays and '\f' have been used. Again, I want to state: you can update the code.

Both of these have been implemented for BlueJ, so you may request to change the code for seamless execution universally.
